They are not exactly the same, although strongly related. This was a very difficult lesson to learn among mathematicians and early programmers, notably in the 70s (mathematical proofs can demand a lot of non-trivial programming work to make them &quot;computable&quot;, as in runnable on a computer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for Machine Learning (by far the most active AI category), modeling belongs to Data Science SE---perhaps the one thing that most people agree on. Implementation should be out of there, as the issues and focus differ (but again, they are related).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, should implementation issues be in AI SE, or StackOverflow? The recurring example is TensorFlow, who's home page states that questions should go to StackOverflow. And we should respect that...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we should keep in mind that the TensorFlow team will choose SO, because it is the largest community, and because the team has something else to do rather than experimenting with hardly visible communities. Well, size matters. We may think that if AI SE becomes big enough on the implementation side, the TensorFlow team (and other major frameworks) may move actually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, I think now that implementation questions would benefit from a dedicated site (my view has evolved since the Area 51 definition phase). I have replied and tried to reply to several SO questions related to ML tools, and I think some are out of place compared to other questions. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38321024/why-this-simple-tensorflow-code-is-not-successful-convnetjs-using-tensorflow/38368469#comment64172189_38368469&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; TensorFlow questions are not really programming questions, and not really framework questions. I mean, there is background knowledge on graph construction and execution, as well as background knowledge about statistics and probabilities that are really necessary to make meaningful contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; questions are out of place on SO. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38297581/tensorflow-gpu-utilization-is-almost-always-at-0#comment64124967_38297581&quot;&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; framework issues or (Python) programming issues, and they are good there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on this opinion, I think the site should be interested in implementation experts, whether they work on ML or Expert Systems (or both?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See also some threads on Area 51 like &lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/23789/the-example-questions-will-not-attract-experts&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/a/23528/69948&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:39:32.930" LastActivityDate="2016-08-03T01:07:12.837" CommentCount="1" />

It is true that AI can indeed be smarter than the creator at certain tasks (AlphaGo being better at Go than the programmers of AlphaGo, for instance). What I think this argument is really saying is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;AI is just bits and bytes programmed by its creator. The creator would be able to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; how the AI works, otherwise he would be unable to create it in the first place. Therefore, the creator can be said to be &lt;em&gt;superior&lt;/em&gt; to that of its creation, since the creator can understand its creation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That seems like a more logical premise. Sure, AlphaGo is better at Go than the programmers of AlphaGo, but AlphaGo's programmers actually knows how AlphaGo operates. This type of argument was made in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://kryten.mm.rpi.edu/lovelace.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Creativity, the Turing Test, and the (better) Lovelace Test&lt;/a&gt;, which specifically argues that  AIs cannot be creative since programmers are able to figure out what their creations (AIs) are doing. Another paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6142v3.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;The Lovelace 2.0 Test of Artificial Creativity and Intelligence&quot;&lt;/a&gt; saw this argument as so self-evidently true that it tried to create a weaker version of the Lovelace Test to identify and measure AI creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The programmers, basically, know how their program works. That doesn't mean the program is less intelligent than the programmers. Just that the programmers can understand why their programs behave the way they do, given enough time and patience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way, I would not support discouraging answers such as these, if only because this view does have support within the AI scholarly community.

However not all AI experts are using or are interested in statistics models with AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example I'm no where near as statistician, I've no idea about cross-validation aka rotation estimation models, but I may use and implement practical AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore I think our site has already its own distinct and unique scope in comparison to Stats.SE, because it is about pure Artificial Intelligence and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can still asks about AI at Stats.SE, but it should be focused to &lt;em&gt;statistical learning&lt;/em&gt;. To support that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2095/12989&quot;&gt;check this post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Question on AI including a comparison with statistical learning would be pretty clearly on topic here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They were accepting even without that, but I think most likely because people didn't have the right place to ask. If they've asked, didn't have much attention (maybe AI experts aren't interested in statistical models).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you've question about theoretical AI, you can consider asking at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ai.artificial-intel&quot;&gt;CSTheory.SE&lt;/a&gt; (not active either).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can only hope that after &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/no-artificial-intelligence-in-area-51/&quot;&gt;6 years&lt;/a&gt; of previous failures, we're able to break some ice this time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've one-time final opportunity to not have AI spread across the whole network:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stats.SE, CSTheory.SE, CogSci.SE, Philosophy.SE, Worldbuilding.SE, SO.SE, CS.SE, HSM.SE, Robotics.SE, GameDev.SE, gosh where else, with no real AI experts in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically the goal of this site is as pointed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11658/faked-artificial-intelligence-like-in-game-development#comment18885_11709&quot;&gt;@lejlot&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To bring people from this one particular field, which exists in&#xA;  between all above in one place. I see the reason behind it - as now&#xA;  questions regarding AI are scattered across these sites and get very&#xA;  little attention from actual experts, who also visit just a subset of&#xA;  these. Additionally - on each site these questions are tagged in a&#xA;  different way, so it is impossible to track them.

This AI programmer is a migratory beast, out to stitch together random answers on Stack Exchange into a coherent 'whole' that he can then use. ... Is it sensible for AI programmers to be &lt;em&gt;dependent&lt;/em&gt; on 6 to 8 different sites, at any given time? Is it sensible for these 6 to 8 sites to &lt;em&gt;pander&lt;/em&gt; to these AI programmers instead of answering other questions? Or is it better to instead consolidate AI-specific questions from these 6 to 8 different sites, onto a single site that is easy to browse and look up? Some overlap between the communities may be inevitable, but it's better than the current status quo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This idea has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/a/25180/152111&quot;&gt;resurrected by by kenorb recently&lt;/a&gt; very recently:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If it fails, the backup is to have 20 different accounts and ask the AI questions across the different sites such as Stats.SE, CSTheory.SE, CogSci.SE, Philosophy.SE, Worldbuilding.SE, SO.SE, CS.SE, HSM.SE, Robotics.SE, GameDev.SE, with no real AI experts focused in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have built &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackai.herokuapp.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;StackAI&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, a StackExchange aggregator of several AI-related StackExchange sites which I may plan on upgrading in the future to include other AI-related StackExchange sites (such as CogSci, Robotics, etc.). But I'm still dubious on whether this site would indeed be the best solution for our crisis. It's a good one-stop directory to help a migratory questioner know &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; they can ask their questions, but the process is still rather inefficient and we lack the consolidation that a standard AI site could provide for us...and, of course, I doubt that these other sites would even &lt;em&gt;appreciate&lt;/em&gt; the influx of these migratory questioners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there a better way to deal with the migratory AI questioner? Even if it is to just improve StackAI?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I get discouraged and cynical rather easily, so maybe I'm being overly pessimistic about this site.

This nominee believes that &quot;bad&quot; questions can simply be down-voted and allowed to die from lack of activity in &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This nominee believes we can strike a balance between being &quot;beginner friendly&quot; and still keeping things interesting enough to attract experts, but believes that it will take some time to establish our presence in the AI world and attract the high-level researchers and others of that ilk.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I volunteered myself, it should go without saying that I accept this nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am Phillip.

Check also my &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/cv/kenorb&quot;&gt;user CV profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first AI program was a chat bot written over 18 years ago in Pascal with custom written assembler libraries in order to make my school mates believing that they are chatting on IRC with real people, while being on the computers without any internet connection, so other can play games on spare computers with the real network. This worked, for the first 15-30 minutes, later on they could find out that something was wrong or get bored. Second project was involved AI bots protecting IRC channels. I did some AI in games. Since then I am interested in practical applications of AI. This is my long term hobby and interest. Further projects required more sophisticated requirements. Currently I am working on integration AI with the financial algorithms and systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am good team player, so I am able to cooperate with other mods, I'm also available on daily basis (GMT/DST time). I hope we can improve this site by keeping it away from chaos, spam and trolls, to provide high quality site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:39:32.930" LastActivityDate="2017-04-04T23:18:13.407" CommentCount="14" CommunityOwnedDate="2016-08-16T20:39:14.043" />

I think there are questions open... I mean without &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; answer, to say it coarsely. I can imagine, that some answers will turn out to be out-of-date or be outperformed many times. It is possible that in one month or one year we get a very different answer, because &lt;strong&gt;(a)&lt;/strong&gt; Some people are researching actively and discovered something amazing, or &lt;strong&gt;(b)&lt;/strong&gt; New users come to the site (and knew of a better answer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; AI.SX is definitely different from other sites in stackexchage, because the questions are not like &lt;em&gt;quickies&lt;/em&gt;. It is not like &lt;em&gt;I need to solve this urgent issue now, how do I do it?&lt;/em&gt;. Many questions have different answers, which often complement themselves. Also, from the comments on an answer (or question), it can be edited to include new points and will be better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; The former point is much more noticeable, since this site is about &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt;. The topic about specific algorithms or techniques has been discussed here on several meta questions. A side-effect is that the questions tend to be (in my opinion) broader. I personally think that is OK, and wish for a certain discussion rather than &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seeing all that, I think that many questions could be left open for... Well, like forever. Because many are &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; questions, which cannot be &lt;em&gt;solved&lt;/em&gt; like in other sites of the network: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question → Answer → &lt;code&gt;hasaccepted:yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that could lead to more answers in community wiki, to which one comes (next month) after reading some new things or hearing another conference? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or we just get new answers to questions with an accepted answer and switch (the checkmark) if the new is better?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you think will happen?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="70" LastActivityDate="2016-09-04T18:24:51.260" Title="What will happen with questions when AI research advances?"

Fortunately, we have something else to measure answer usefulness:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Votes.&lt;/strong&gt; Posts accept votes forever (in most cases), and new answers (among other events) push the question back onto the site front page so it can be examined anew.

Otherwise claiming the ownership of some question related to AI on other non-AI site which has been asked specifically here or only because it's a technical one, it would be unwise. The point is, that this site is fully dedicated to AI, &lt;em&gt;Cross Validated&lt;/em&gt; site has only few tags related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; and it focuses only on statistical techniques where the questions asked there doesn't have to be related to AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore if the question is asking about statistical techniques, then sure, it's more on-topic at &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Cross Validated&lt;/a&gt;.

In its current state, this site's defined scope makes it useless for anyone who's an expert on AI: all of whom will be interested in creating AI, and will therefore be interested in asking and answering fundamental questions about topics such as structuring and designing AI, which can be asked and answered without involving any code. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, no AI experts are going to be drawn to this current scope, it's essentially only useful for the world building audience, which already has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;popular SE site&lt;/a&gt;.

What we need to do, to help the site get more traction, is to define that boundary in a useful way. At a high level, it wouldn't make sense to reject a site about statistics because a perfectly good mathematics site already existed. Statistics has different goals, conventions, notation, and concerns--even though it's almost all mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd argue that the failures of the previous sites were more a question of timing than content. Serious interest in AI is on the horizon again, very recently, precisely because of advances in ML. That doesn't mean, however, that AI proper is the same thing as ML, or needs to be focused on implementation issues. There's a large amount of theory that isn't necessarily data science, either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We went through some of the same growing pains on Signal Processing. The approach we took there (and I'm not saying it's the right approach for AI), was to concentrate mostly on theory, and avoid implementation details. It's something that didn't exist, and it gave us a way to attract experts who weren't programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Explicitly making the history of AI on-topic, however technical, might be a good starting point to help clarify what a site dedicated to AI can add to the SE network. I'm not saying that it's necessarily off-topic now, but given that MathJax isn't even enabled yet, there's currently a strong bias toward strictly non-technical questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIXI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;AIXI agent&lt;/a&gt; is a good example to begin discussing these issues. It's heavily mathematical, based on reinforcement learning, inspired by statistical reasoning (ala. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Solomonoff's Universal Prior&lt;/a&gt;), and uses non-computable concepts (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kolomogorov Complexity&lt;/a&gt;). So, there's a potential overlap with any number of fields, but really it's proper &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;AGI&lt;/a&gt;. It's a much more practical definition of intelligence than, say, the Turing Test--precisely because it's defined mathematically. At the very least, it seems like definitions of intelligence should be on-topic, and we need math for those.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might warrant a completely separate meta question, but I'll offer one thought on how to help clarify the scope of the site (in addition to including AI history). Let's start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Peter Norvig's&lt;/a&gt; definition of AI (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4/franck-dernoncourt&quot;&gt;Frank Dernoncort's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.francky.me/doc/20120530%20-%20AI%20and%20Business%20-%20CCSF%20Paris.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We think of AI as understanding the world and deciding how to  make &#xA;  good  decisions.

Artificial intelligence in a very strict sense should only contain questions pertaining to how we can create truly intelligent (creative, aware, etc.) machines. Whereas data science is directly the manipulation of data in order to produce tools to make something better (image detection, intrusion detection, etc.). The separation is very blurry and I do not think that intelligence can exist without information/data, and its manipulations. However, most machine learning and deep learning demonstrated are simply conducting complex function approximations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, due to the popularization of machine learning and especially deep learning, the manipulation of data has created the impression of intelligent machine due to it being capable of competing with human performance in very targeted tasks (object recognition, segmentation, etc.). Evidently, the name artificial intelligence catches people's attention much more than data science or machine learning. Thus, it is common for news which is essentially generic data science/machine learning to be called artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is further demonstrated on the Artificial Intelligence site where the majority of the questions are pertaining more to data science and machine learning than truly discussing possibilities, methods or emerging work pertaining to machines capable of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This niche can easily be encapsulated into a site that combines both Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Post on Data Science is found &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2352/should-this-site-be-combined-with-the-artificial-intelligence-stack-exchange/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5925" LastEditorUserId="75" LastEditDate="2018-02-05T17:36:11.147" LastActivityDate="2018-02-21T18:28:32.510" Title="Should this site be combined with the Data Science stack exchange?"

Such questions are (in my opinion) better answered on StackOverflow.

For example a deep learning question asked on either of the sites only, will not reach as many answerers, this hurts the questioner's chances of getting the best possible answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibility of people with a strong implementation background whom are more likely to peruse Data Science, to also be involved in discussions regarding the ethics and morality of artificial intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibility of those more interested in the humanities of artificial intelligence to see the kinds of problems that machine learning algorithms are capable of solving and forging stronger arguments about the ethical use and morality of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, artificial intelligence does not yet exist, very fancy computational models which are essentially hyper-plane separators are not intelligent.

However reading through Stack Overflow and Data Science usually occupies most of the time I want to spend on my couch.

This increased vulnerability appears to be due to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More difficult to detect. Due to the small nature of the site, it's quite natural that you see the same accounts interacting in multiple questions if they just happen to be very active users. On a huge site like Stackoverflow, it would be a much larger coincidence if the same two accounts kept repeatedly interacting with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More negative impact. If two accounts (operated by the same person or by close friends for example) are consistently upvoting each other and double-downvoting &quot;competing&quot; answers, that has a huge impact on a small site like AI StackExchange where there generally are only a handful of votes to begin with. On a larger site like StackOverflow, such votes would more easily get drowned out by &quot;real&quot; votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question&lt;/strong&gt;: do others agree that AI StackExchange may indeed be extra vulnerable, and if so, should additional actions be taken? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is indeed a concrete case of two rather active accounts on the AI StackExchange from which I've seen so much suspicious stuff happening that I can't believe it's a coincidence anymore as described in my first point above (and googling for their names actually lead to additional off-site evidence that they're both the same person as well).

The information may be authentically reproduced from the results of a web search and that information may too sound good but lack rigor or peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The classic example of this later case is Wikipedia.  The oversight of that site is well aware of the fact that many Wikipedia pages and sections lack peer review or reflect popular trends that have not been properly tested or very deeply considered.  Most universities have departmental policies to not allow sources that are essentially blogs in theses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example that I've seen in this AI beta and the SE sub-sites is the referencing of a sentence from the abstract or conclusion of a paper accompanied by an interpretation that conflicts with the facts in the body of the paper.  I'm aware that people want to support their views and do searches, and I've done that on occasion too.  However, we all must be aware that the quality of the site is highest when we all work to investigate the reliability of what we are quoting or referencing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People are vulnerable to misinformation, even if accidental, and this is an information disseminating community.  That's the concern of greatest importance, but that vulnerability is not a vulnerability of the SE system.  It is a vulnerability of the readership.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of Negative Global Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The SO site and associated SE sub-sites are powerful.  For instance, some semantic impressions have formed in SO that design questions are too broad.  That may have been done for reasons that seemed wise, but the result is that SO has a corresponding impact on the global development community: Dismissal of design.  Again, a vulnerability of the readership.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size and the Influence of an Individual or Small Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the correlation between size and the impact of activity of an individual or those who work together in a team in a workplace or lab, yes that is true.  The larger the group, the lesser the relative impact of one or a few people.  For that very reason, some prefer smaller groups because they feel more relevant, which is why the sub-sites are growing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the correlation flips when considering detection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is actually more difficult to detect especially large impact from one or a small group in the larger group.  A few people who just happen to have similar backgrounds or have read a similar set of material for work related reasons will stand out more in smaller communities than in larger ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question has that aspect backward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining Positive Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether that impact is positive or negative is reflected (and should be reflected) in the up votes or down votes, not the opinions of those that may notice what appears to them like excessive corroboration.  When scrutinizing game-play, the developers of the system will naturally examine questions about trends.  Regarding individual accounts or groups that work or live together, the question should be ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are there any votes that appeared that are without merit?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Were there any published member rules broken?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are members collaborating to trounce on others?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are members trolling to crush other individual members or ganging up on them to remove what they imagine to be a threat?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are the questions I have too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question mentions gaming, where in fact all SO and SE sub-site members are in game play.  The system is deliberately set up as a game.  It is a zero sum game in that the point scores are relative as in some sports, therefore the increased success of one member may threaten the success of another.  The game system is not the design of the member.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the choice of the member is intent.  Some are here to compete; others to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That privileges must be earned is the more fixed point, and less relative, so there is some communal value to those who have decades of experience and tend to apply mathematical rigor and interest in social responsibility to questions to game out sufficient point score to positively impact the larger parameters of game-play.  That too is how the system is set up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best leaders in this community (as with the larger community of humanity) are the ones that are willing to engage in the silliness of game play without particular interest in winning but to game well enough to get more factual and productive information out to people so they can make wiser decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actions to be Taken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The actions to be taken are the rules of the game.  Of course, as in tennis, appealing to the umpire is permitted, but not always productive, especially if the umpire tips the scales against a contributor as a result of the appeal in such a way as to suppress or censor useful perspectives that contain needed qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Censorship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mathematical rigor is not always appreciated by those who don't value it, yet it is objectively useful, especially in science and technology.  Those with decades of experience are not always appreciated by those that cannot speak from experience as easily.  Because this is natural, those with more experience should respect the need of novices to gain experience gradually as they once did.  So the experienced and the novice should yield to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Minority views are by their very nature unappreciated.  When they are repeatedly expressed with vigor and they have a disruptive quality or challenge the status quo, the reaction can be a mob scene.  The mob is usually made up those that have used the status quo or trendy ideas to gain reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, SE AI members are above that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Accounts in One Household, Workplace, or Laboratory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although it is true that in communities, local ones, FaceBook groups, and SO ones, there are people who know each other and work together so that they have similar patterns of speech when talking on the topics in which they collaborate for family life, activism, or work.  It does not mean they are cheating in some way.  To those in the group working together, what they do is collaborate, which is no threat to an SO or SE site because they have thrived with couples, work teams, and many other collaborating groups interacting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, those who appear in public to always be in agreement may not always be in agreement privately.  Families, laboratory teams, and those who work closely in the industry have just learned to withhold argumentation with their close friends, family, and work and laboratory associates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, others may have legitimacy or malice in their intent, but score based systems are technically games, and we all play together.

The evidence for the below reasons is clearly evident not only in the titles and bodies of the most popular questions and answers but also in tag usage, the top ten being these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Neural networks&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Machine learning&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Deep learning&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;CNNs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reinforcement&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI design&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Image recognition&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Algorithm&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Classification&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Training&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Less than 1% of the content is about life and challenges in world where cognitive automation is emerging.  It is likely that many of our members couldn't distinguish a cognitive function from either first order predicate logic or learned routine.  The later two can be simulated in many respects with current digital systems, but it is unclear whether, in this century, cognition will be simulated.  I know that's not the popular conception, but those with the greater experience that have been watching AI and working in the field for decades know it to be the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are my reasons why I think the current AI meta site definition is not consistent with either expectation, actual content, or the real interests of the membership.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A large proportion of the most active and interesting questions are about what can and has been done in the area of machine learning.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robotics appears and should appear in the content for the AI beta.  To begin with, the field of AI was as much born out of the need for control systems faster than humans to defend against attacking aircraft and intercontinental ballistic missiles than as a way to do proofs using formal logic.  More importantly, the long awaited for emergence of autonomous vehicles, automated vacuum cleaners, and a host of other non-military intelligent control systems is no longer held back by the prices of control system components (CPU, motor drivers, memory, operating system) and the applicable machine learning strategies are now on GitHub and packaged in Python and Java libraries.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many of the current AI beta Q&amp;amp;A are lacking in scientific rigor even though the AI beta is in the &lt;strong&gt;Science&lt;/strong&gt; SE category.  The use of mathematics is a quality factor in a science site as much as inclusion of academic references or narrowness of the problems set forth in the questions.  I think it is correct to assemble AI under &lt;strong&gt;Science&lt;/strong&gt; and not &lt;strong&gt;Technology&lt;/strong&gt; because the technology side is covered under SE sites such as Arduino and Data Science, which are properly placed in the &lt;strong&gt;Technology&lt;/strong&gt; category.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don't see a membership-wide interest in, &quot;Questions about life and challenges in a world where &quot;cognitive&quot; functions can be mimicked in purely digital environment.&quot;  People are aware that some job functions get replaced in the human job market by machines, and we've been, as a culture, adapting to it since the late 19th century.  Industrialization saw the emergence automated cotton picking, textile manufacture, type setting, and electronics assembly.  Most people, myself included, will actually be happy when office worker and programming is automated.  It's boring and no more psychologically healthy than coal mining was healthy for breathing.  Our members are not here not to ask questions about how to live or face the changes but to engage in right-now-present-day adaptation to what is so obviously the nearing of another big job market swing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For reasons given above, &quot;Cognition,&quot; is not the best choice of words to describe the relevant AI research and development under way today.  Notice that the word cognition or questions surrounding it are rare in tagging, titling, and discussion.  What is currently being synthesized is the lower mammalian functions that do not take place in the cerebral cortex and have no relationship with comprehension, discernment, or insight.  AI beta Q&amp;amp;A does not fit into the cognitive science definition of cognition or the dictionary definition of it.  For instance, character recognition, visual collision detection, identity recognition, and such are not cognitive functions.  Artificial analysis of large data sets, not for training but for feature extraction, is not cognitive either.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's much more pointing to the inadequacy of the current description but I'll stop there.  Back to the central question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the current out-facing description of the AI meta descriptive of what it is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The co-question is this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is discussion about life in a changing world really what is relevant to most people who would search for &lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; in the search field of SE?

Again, I think the answer is &quot;no&quot;. Those topics may be interesting and relevant for some, and it's fine to allow them, but I suspect that much more detailed questions about specific little things in AI are more relevant to more people that happen to find their way onto this site. In my opinion, the description should indeed be adapted to allow more &quot;technical&quot; questions... basically, allow the kinds of questions we see many of. Not necessarily technical in the sense of &quot;why doesn't this snippet of code work&quot;, but technical in the sense of &quot;how/why/in what cases should this part of an algorithm work?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few minor nitpickings from me:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Many of the current AI beta Q&amp;amp;A are lacking in scientific rigor even though the AI beta is in the Science SE category.

StackExchange as a whole (all sites across the entire network) tends to be primarily about &quot;quick&quot; questions and answers, about building a site that people can easily reach through google searches, quickly see a question relevant to their search terms, and quickly find an answer that addresses their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most questions really don't need answers with a thorough literature review, like a scientific paper would. Some do, sometimes there'll a really great question that is best addressed with a great answer containing interesting references to literature, etc... kind of like how, on StackOverflow, you'll sometimes find great answers with lots of different possible solutions, a lot of work put into timing the different implementations, explaining observed performance differences, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's certainly not necessary for the majority of questions though. Many more questions are asked by non-experts, or first-year or second-year students for example. They might use slightly incorrect terminology, not be aware of all kinds of other potential solutions, etc. But when they have a clear question about an algorithm they're learning about, they just need an answer to that, they don't need a thorough literature review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I think it is correct to assemble AI under Science and not Technology because &lt;strong&gt;the technology side is covered under SE sites such as Arduino and Data Science&lt;/strong&gt;, which are properly placed in the Technology category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't agree with the bolded part there. I've personally never heard of Arduino, but a quick google search does not tell me how that covers a major part of AI at all, it seems really specific and niche. AI is also much much more than just Data Science. AI includes things like search algorithms, planning, pathfinding, and probably much more stuff that is not Data Science. People need a place to ask questions about all that, and it's not covered by any other StackExchange site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1641" LastActivityDate="2018-08-01T20:08:17.367" CommentCount="2" />

I have the following concerns here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Usage guidance doesn't really tell us for which questions it should or shouldn't be used. It starts out with a bunch of fancy words that don't tell me anything about its relation to AI.

Again, lots of fancy words, but not much real information (definitely not &lt;strong&gt;clear&lt;/strong&gt; information).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The tag wiki gives some examples of things that are &quot;features of topology&quot; or are &quot;topological&quot;, but we still don't have a clear description of what it's supposed to be.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;second point&lt;/strong&gt;, I have the following concern:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It dives straight into &quot;Correct Use&quot; and &quot;Misuse&quot; headers, which is already hinting at the definition being up for debate, having multiple uses, being potentially ambiguous or not generally agreed upon. More importantly, &lt;strong&gt;as someone familiar with Neural Networks this might be plain incorrect according to my experiences&lt;/strong&gt;. I say &quot;might be&quot; rather than &quot;is&quot; because the text is so incomprehensibly complicated that I can't tell for sure what it's actually saying.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, in AI, when people are talking about &quot;topology&quot; in the context of Neural Networks, it's used to describe the &quot;architecture&quot; of the Network; how many layers, what types of layers, how large is each layer, what activation functions do we put in between, where are the connections (typically a feature of layer type). That's basically it, and that can be explained very clearly in language that can be understood easily. Some sources:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-neural-network-architecture-and-topology&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;A quora question&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;A well-known paper on using evolutionary search to optimize a Neural Network's topology&lt;/a&gt; (indeed, it's evolving the &quot;structure&quot; of the neural network).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many more similar sources can be found through a google search for &quot;Neural Network topology&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is specifically in the &lt;strong&gt;context of Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt;. This will likely be the most common natural usage of the tag on this site. However, as also mentioned in the proposed tag wiki, &lt;strong&gt;topology is also a completely different field of mathematics&lt;/strong&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-has-topology-got-to-do-with-machine-learning&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;that field of mathematics may sometimes be relevant in a completely different manner in the field of AI&lt;/a&gt;. So, &quot;topology&quot; can be &lt;strong&gt;ambiguous&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;probably should not be restricted only to the usage in the context of Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a final concern, I am wondering what a header saying &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Only Possible Logical Conclusion&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; is doing in a tag wiki. That's a header I'd expect in an opinion piece, or maybe as an overly-sensationalized header after a mathematical proof.

The only argument against having Data Science questions on AI.se that I'm aware of basically boils down to trying to avoid as much overlap as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, that kind of overlap really isn't too much of a problem. The topic in the question (entity recognition from text) is certainly a topic that could be described as being a part of &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;, and it would be just as correct as saying it's a &quot;Data Science&quot; topic. So I personally really wouldn't mind if it's allowed on either site, I can see it fitting in either just fine. I understand that StackExchange as a complete network might find it more problematic if there's too much overlap, and if that's the case their opinion is probably more important than mine, I just don't experience it as problematic personally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only sentence in the question you linked to that is maybe a bit questionable in my opinion is the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have tried Spacy and NLTK for entity extraction but that doesn't suffice above requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That sentence is describing specific tools/frameworks, and implies the question-asker might be looking for more names of similarly specific tools/frameworks. I do feel those kinds of questions would be a better fit for Data Science. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the same question, especially if you ignore that one sentence, can easily be interpreted as being of a more conceptual nature, asking more generally about techniques/algorithms that would be applicable.
